                <p>RQ: The theory and practice of management is totally different now to how Frederick Taylor imagined it in his ‘Principles of Scientific Management’. Discuss with reference to Scientific Management.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>Scientific management, as one of the most important management theories in history, Taylor has made significant impacts on the development of modern management practices (Locke, 1982). However, Taylorism was introduced in the early 20th century. Since then, the business environment and society have changed rapidly. The theory and practice of management have also evolved over time. Therefore, the question has been raised, is Taylorism still relevant in modern management?</p>
<p>The essential idea of Taylorism is the rational way of organizing workflows. Taylor believed that management can be practiced as a science, which implied that productivity can be maximized by managers controlling and formulating systematic workflows based on worker behaviors. As Taylor himself described it as “directly antagonistic to the old ideas that each workman can best regulate his own way of doing the work” (Taylor, 1911). After the industrial revolution in the 18th century, management was somewhat unorganized and irrelevant to production in factories (Citeman, 2008). Taylor’s approach had given more defined roles to managers to improve efficiency. Meanwhile, in the 1890s, America expanded into a modern industrial country, with massive growth in factories where more efficient management practices were in great needs (Caldari, 2007). Taylor’s suggestions on initiatives and incentives were dominant and widely adopted in worker-motivation and productivity from 1900-20 (Miller &amp; Form, 1952). In his well-known experiment of pig iron, although he justified how his methods increased productivity and how workers earned more money in the end, the accuracy and reliability of his methodology were questioned by many researchers.</p>
<p>In particular, a study conducted in 2000 has shown that all data observed by Taylor have no inconsistencies at all, which is almost impossible for a practical experiment. There is also a lack of scientific evidence in Taylor’s incomplete storytelling (Wrege &amp; Hodgetts, 2000). The controversies did not stop there. Scientific management was accused to be inhuman, as workers are actually overworked and underpaid (Drury, 1915). Later theories have discovered other aspects that affect the productivity of employees. For instance, the human relation theory has highlighted the significance of social and human perspectives on motivation in the workplace and provided directions for the development of work psychology (Mayo, 1933). Braverman also suggested that Taylorism is simply a tool for capitalists to exercise control over workers and it might result in worker alienation and deskilling (Braverman, 1974). While Littler argued that Taylorism is the bureaucratization of the structure of control, the institutionalization of it is actually the key and as he put it, “has a continuing influence West and East” (Littler, 1978). Despite the criticisms and the emergence of newer management theories, parts of Taylorism still survived and in fact, a modern concept of neo-Taylorism, which binds most of Taylor’s original ideas with the psychological aspects to work is implemented in many businesses today (Pruijt, 2003).</p>
<p>Although these debates have made the issue more complicated, most researchers in the field do agree on his profound contribution and share a common understanding that there are still existences of Taylorism today (Taneja, et al., 2011). Therefore, this essay aims to discuss to what extent is Taylorism relevant and effective to the theory and practice of management today?</p>
<p><strong>2.Main Body:</strong><br>
<strong>2.1. Workers and managers</strong></p>
<p>One of the key concepts that Taylor developed was the time-and-motion study, which emphasizes breaking down workers’ behaviors and establishing the “one-best-way” to carry out tasks, and training workers systematically instead of leaving them to train themselves (Koumparoulis &amp; Solomos, 2012). It has undoubtedly improved workers’ productivity. This sense of standardization continuously proves its worthiness in not only numerous factories around the world today, but also in education. Recent research shows that a new form of Taylorism has emerged in 21st-century curriculum, as teachers’ practices are increasingly standardized by high-stake testing and scripted curriculum (Au, 2011). Initially, it aims to improve the general quality and efficiency of teaching in fields such as reading and sciences, which can be easily measured through standardized tests (Apple &amp; Jungck, 1990). However, the tasks of teachers become extremely basic, and their powers are usurped through constraints and curriculums. Unlike Taylorism, modern researchers have discovered more aspects to work motivation apart from monetary incentives. According to Pink, such practice would demotivate employees since autonomy is absent, which means teachers cannot perform in desired ways (Pink, 2009). In addition, an interview conducted in the workplace has shown that 40% of the interviewees think self-motivation has significant impacts on work creativity. The lack of creativity-relevant skills will discourage personal engagement and innovation (Amabile, 1988). Nevertheless, there is also evidence indicating that many personality traits of teaching-effective professors are also those of creative professors (Rushton, et al., 1983). It implies that the quality of teaching is affected by the creativity of teachers. Furthermore, this may also incur deskilling, since materials are pre-packaged, and teachers are only responsible for repetitive execution (Apple, 1995). In short, Taylorism has increased the productivity of workers and suggested how to motivate them, but only on a surface level.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the concepts of scientific management have indeed given managers more defined responsibilities and provided them with directions to utilize resources more efficiently (Chand, 2021). Littler argued that scientific management has much deeper implications than other ideologies such as human relation, as it leaves the structure of control and division of labor largely untouched. Whereas Taylorism has been institutionalized and rooted in managerial responsibility and training (Littler, 1978). However, Follet proposed the need for integrative unity, which involves workers having more control over their tasks and redistribution of function. Moreover, educate workers with general business knowledge would also help them to make intelligent decisions (Follet, 1925). This approach aims to blur the traditional line between managers and workers and encourage them to take more ownership in their roles so that everyone collectively contributes to the organization. Thus, modern managers need to integrate the interests of all parties. Barnard went even further than Follet. He addressed the nature of executive responsibility, which is much more complex than simply breaking down tasks and giving instructions to workers. He demonstrated the need for leaders to create value and faith for their workers (Barnard, 1938). The inability to do so may result in irresponsibility and moral conflicts of employees. Follet and Barnard both emphasized that managerial responsibility has evolved over time, there are more aspects that modern managers need to consider outside of Taylor’s restricted views.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Practice in the field &amp; Society</strong></p>
<p>With all these theories in mind, we shall look at some practical implementations in the field. Total quality management (TQM) has been widely put into practice by companies such as Ford and Toyota (Hashmi, 2012). It was derived from Deming’s 14 points of management, which suggests that companies need to make organization-wide efforts to continuously improve product quality while minimizing costs, thus gain competitiveness in the market (Deming, 1982). TQM highlights on manager’s role in designing detailed work processes to improve quality. In addition, management must continuously analyze the variabilities through surveillance and collecting systematic data from work processes. The analysis should also be understood by workers themselves (Hackman &amp; Wageman, 1995). TQM takes advantage of Taylor’s time and motion study, builds on its idea of cost-minimization and enhances its surveillance component. It aims to control the uniformity of products, workers and the entire system of production at all levels within the organization (Dahlgaard, et al., 1998). However, TQM has received similar criticisms as Taylorism, accused to be unethical since it overlooks the interests of workers and treats individuals indifferently as machines (Boje &amp; Winsor, 1993). Despite that, TQM’s initiative on continuous adjustments and analyzing variances using quantitative data still have a great contribution to modern control systems (Tarí, 2005).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, workers at Amazon are also experiencing a “twisted” version of Taylorism, namely the digital-Taylorism. Digital-Taylorism refers to the standardization and rationalization of knowledge work through information technology (Brown, et al., 2012). Amazon’s obsession with measuring productivity has been supercharged with digital technology and applied to not only industrial workers, but also service workers and managers (Schein, 2017). Reports show that Amazon has invented a wristband to track workers’ hands in real-time for surveillance. All tasks are accurately timed, and workers are required to retrieve an item every nine seconds for ten and half hours (SALAME, 2018). Meanwhile, Amazon also uses a complex system that integrates the tools of data, management and psychology to set targets and control managers. The performance of employees is constantly being measured by algorithms (Smith, 2020). Despite the demanding culture at Amazon, some former employees still claimed it to be humane and they were given the opportunity to share their opinions in meetings (Streitfeld &amp; Kantor, 2015). The socio-technical system has also emphasized the positive interrelationship between human and technology, which enhances both social and technical aspects of work (Trist, 1981). At the same time, a recent study indicates that the advancement of technology has complemented Taylorism by supplementing the human aspects. The contributions of employees are analyzed and highly valued at all levels (Uddina &amp; Hossainb, 2015).</p>
<p>On the other hand, digital-Taylorism has still been criticized for job dissatisfaction and decreasing motivation, since the knowledge workers have few opportunities to think (Glover, 2013). According to the goal-setting theory, such intense and difficult goals could also demotivate employees and make them feel even less committed (Locke, et al., 1981). Moreover, the theory of Personality Systems Interactions addresses that social interaction patterns vary between different people, sometimes employees impose their goals and needs on their peers, which might incur mental disorders (Kuhl, 2000). Early theories of work design like Taylorism, focused on efficiency and cost reduction, whereas the modern development of work design pays more attention to motivation and well-being (Arnold &amp; Randall, 2016). It is widely accepted that the variety and autonomy of the job have significant impacts on workers’ commitment and satisfaction (Wall, 1982). Some researchers have been investigating to combine both the efficiency element of Taylorism and the variety and autonomy element. Through experiment, they found that it was possible to improve both efficiency and satisfaction at the same time (MORGESON &amp; CAMPION, 2006). At this point, it is obvious that scientific management has proved its worthiness to modern organizations, but not in its original form.</p>
<p>As society progresses, Taylorism has also evolved over time to better suit the current organizational environments. Many studies have pointed out that businesses are shifting from being organization-oriented, which focuses on internal factors such as production efficiency to market-oriented, putting customers in the center (Fahy &amp; Jobber, 2015). Besides, successful modern companies tend to take advantages of both centralization and decentralization. Their underlying structures are simple but extremely flexible and adjustable. Most importantly, they live their commitment to people and put innovation at the heart (Waterman &amp; Peters, 1982). These differences in the business environment have forced Taylorism to change as well. From the examples discussed above, we can see that many modern theories are developed from the emergence of the original Taylorism and newer discoveries to management effectiveness, such as work psychology and digitalization.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, we have discussed the effectiveness of Taylorism from the perspective of both workers and managers in modern settings. It demonstrates that Taylorism has indeed provided a solid understanding and direction on efficiency, motivation and managerial responsibility, but only at a basic level. Then the practical evidence has also suggested that Taylorism is still relevant, it has even been re-formed and implemented in some of the biggest companies today. Therefore, to what extent is Taylorism relevant and effective in modern society? Even though the business environment has changed rapidly and there are many more aspects to consider in management since 1911, it is undoubtedly that Taylorism is still relevant today. However, how effective is it? As discussed, Taylorism today is no longer in its original form. In fact, a recent concept of the surplus population addresses that the workers whom Taylor originally described in scientific management are gradually being replaced by automated machines (Murray-Li, 2010). The modern Taylorism combines its initial proposal on productivity with later findings on management effectiveness. However, the fundamental problem seems unsolved. Similar to Amazon, call centers as another reflection of the digital-Taylorism shows that the many jobs are still repetitive under strict surveillance, and sometimes even unethical (Taylor &amp; Bain, 2003). The performance and outcome of such practice seem productive though, so is it effective? In the past when Taylorism was developed, the phrase “management effectiveness” was almost exclusively regarded to production efficiency, whereas now it also concerns the ability to adjust to the changing environment, ethics, work psychology and much more (Waterman &amp; Peters, 1982). Under the new definition of management effectiveness, Taylorism today fails to be effective. However, the irony, the tragedy is exactly the fact that Taylorism is still hugely relevant in modern management practices. Perhaps the nature of the work that Taylor described has never changed fundamentally, it has only transformed into the shell of more modernized roles, such as teachers, call agents or programmers. This raises the concern that management practices might never find a way around Taylorism.</p>
