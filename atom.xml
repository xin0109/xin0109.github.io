<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>University plays a key role in the changes and transformations in our society (Brennan, et al., 2004). In recent years, issues regarding equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) have become the central topic around the world and universities must take initiatives to solve these problems. Equality is often regarded as having equal rights and opportunities instead of everyone being identical (Caruana &amp; Ploner, 2010). Scheffler claims that equality can be classified as distributive and relational equality. The former refers to egalitarian distribution of resources, whereas the latter is an ideal governing certain kind of interpersonal relationships (Scheffler, 2015). On the other hand, inequality and discrimination against certain groups has existed for centuries. Woman’s right to education and racial segregation are historical examples of inequality in education due to differences in gender and race (Zajda, 2009). In recent years, these differences have been reconceptualized as diversity, and it is defined or perceived as a competitive advantage, a diverse group of people are able to bring new skills and aptitudes (Wood, et al., 2006). Diversity can be either physical which refers to bio-demographic differences, or cognitive, differences in perspectives and problem-solving habits (ELI Inc., 2020). Inclusion in the broader sense is to embrace the minorities so that they feel accepted and equally treated (Global Diversity Practice, 2020). However, inclusivity these days often exclusively refers to disability education (Schuelka, et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Bear in mind that these interpretations are not definite. Educators in the fields lack a common understanding of these concepts. One of the examples is the Least Restrictive Environment law in the US, which states that students with disabilities should study alongside with other peers in the same classroom (Copenhaver, 2006). However, Crockett and Kauffman argued that such an approach to inclusion might result in an even more restrictive environment for disabled students than segregated classrooms (Crockett &amp; Kauffman, 2013). These differences in understanding are due to perspectives and personality traits. Students with disabilities who are also outgoing might enjoy studying with other peers, whereas some might find it awkward and depressing (Ashton, 2013). The social identity theory suggests that one’s self image is associated with the comparisons between himself and relevant social groups, which can also have significant impacts on intergroup behaviours (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). In this case, disabled students might have negative associations when comparing themselves to normal students. Therefore, it is essential to focus on developing both behavioural strategies as well as physical implementations, such as policies.</p>
<p>This essay aims to discover the possible implementations that would achieve a higher degree of EDI. It is crucial to approach the problem from different perspectives in order for a comprehensive respond. It is also necessary to discuss to what extent do these recommendations work in the context of higher education.</p>
<h2 id="main-body">Main body</h2>
<p>Equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) have become the main theme in higher education in recent year. As there is no one universal understanding to EDI, universities around the world have taken different approaches and faced various challenges. A commonly used approach is to set up dedicated teams and sections on the website to acknowledge the importance of EDI. For instance, the University of Manchester (UoM) produces reports on their progress annually, including initiatives, policies and more (University of Manchester, 2020). This is an effective practice that would not only make a clear statement to the public, but also raise awareness in EDI. However, this information can be selective and incomplete. There is a lack of specific data for each course program. According to research, some fields of study are much less diverse. Such as the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Data from American Physical Society has shown that only about 12% of the total students receiving bachelor’s degree and 7% receiving PhD in physics are from underrepresented backgrounds in the US (APS physics, 2018). To resolve the problem, the University of Michigan (UM) initiated the Applied Physics program where they enhance the collaborations between physics department and other departments (Clarke &amp; Kurdak, 2019). It provides underrepresented students with more information and opportunities to explore the world of physics and counters the perception of “few career paths”. This approach was able to increase the percentage of underrepresented students receiving physics PhD to 23%. Also, 29% of physics PhD were awarded to women in UM, whereas only 17% on average in the US. Many underrepresented students in the PhD program are willing to become mentors for incoming students and it is foreseeable that EDI will continue to improve. As a result, it is suggested that universities should first acknowledge all existing or potential issues to a higher degree of specification. In order to gain more accurate insights and find out the internal drivers of underrepresented students, we can approach the problem using learning theories. The theory of constructivism suggests that people construct their knowledge based on their reality and experiences. The construction is also directly associated with learners’ social connections (WGU, 2020). In this case, underrepresented students might have little or no knowledge at all in many subject areas due to their limited personal experiences. For instance, science is one of the most expensive degrees and students from low-income families might just give up on their interests in sciences (Else, 2015). University should provide opportunities for students to get exposed and have hands-on experiences in these areas of study. This can not only be implemented through university staff, other social connections such as peers and industrial partners can be effective as well. ¬¬</p>
<p>Another controversial topic in EDI is gender equality. In particular, gender equality for university staff has been overlooked compared to students. There was a widespread idea that the student equality is a greater priority than staff equality (DEEM &amp; MORLEY, 2006). A study of attitudes to gender equality in the UK and Germany has shown that although there were only very little harassments or unfair practices against female in HE nowadays, 73% of the participants still thought their university is a gendered workplace and 78% thought there were too few women in senior roles (Pritchard, 2010). More recent evidence suggests that in the UK, of all academic staff described as a professor, only 25% are female (HESA, 2018). This implies that male power still dominates in university academics. On the other side of the world, Australian universities have had outstanding progress in gender equality. In 2017 45.4% of academic staff and 32.4% of senior academic staff are female (Larkins, 2017). One of the techniques is that a sample of employees will be selected annually from every organization to report against a set of criteria regarding organizations’ efforts towards gender equality (Australian Legislation, 2000). This act had great effects in monitoring organizations and provided insights on how to improve gender equality in the workplace. The engagement of community leaders is also essential in order to make greater influence and sustain positive changes (Haider, 2012). An action plan initiated by senior women in Australian universities involved setting up multiple development programmes for female academic staff.  More recently, they have built on this plan which emphasizes the recognition of the contributions of women to universities, the importance of mentoring women in middle management as future leaders and the showcase of senior executive women at strategic points throughout the programmes (Winchester &amp; Browning, 2015). The significance of these strategies is clear, universities must provide extra supports and information to close the gender gaps in professional developments (Traning Journal, 2015), so that women have the same career opportunities as men. However, information might not be enough to change behaviors and this is why behavior sciences are vital in this process (Mantashian, 2019). The nudge theory states that our behaviors and decisions are largely affected by positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions in the environment (Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008). Google has one of the most elaborate workplace environments. Creative settings such as treadmills or Tinker Toys in the office have improved employees’ wellbeing and productivity (Stewart, 2013). Therefore, the way that university offices and classrooms are set up can have significant impact on people’s behaviors towards gender equality.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>UM’s approach to enhance collaboration between departments, initiatives taken by Australian universities to promote female academics have impacted EDI significantly in a positive way. And their methods have commonalities. These evidences have suggested that universities must ensure that everyone has equal access to essential information and opportunities, identify underrepresented groups and extra support should also be made available for these groups. At the same time, the importance of behavioral strategies is as critical as physical policies. Due to the differences in personality and experiences, educators might not need a common definition and different perspectives are actually needed to address injustices (Schuelka, et al., 2019). Despite multiple perspectives have been taken into account, the coverage of this essay is still limited. There are simply much more aspects that educators need to consider, especially when dealing with personality traits. For instance, the cognitive diversity theory studies beyond the common identity diversity such as race and gender (ELI Inc., 2020), it creates more layers of complexity in achieving EDI. This might be an indication that universities will never be able to take consideration of all factors. But is that the goal anyways? At this stage, more questions have been raised which are out of the scope of the essay. In fact, all recommendations made in this essay would only be partially effective. Yet as long as universities show consistent commitments to these issues, EDI will continue to improve and these questions will eventually be resolved, not only in classrooms, but also in society.</p>
