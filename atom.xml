        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>RQ: The theory and practice of management is totally different now to how Frederick Taylor imagined it in his ‘Principles of Scientific Management’. Discuss with reference to Scientific Management.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>Scientific management, as one of the most important management theories in history, Taylor has made significant impacts on the development of modern management practices (Locke, 1982). However, Taylorism was introduced in the early 20th century. Since then, the business environment and society have changed rapidly. The theory and practice of management have also evolved over time. Therefore, the question has been raised, is Taylorism still relevant in modern management?</p>
<p>The essential idea of Taylorism is the rational way of organizing workflows. Taylor believed that management can be practiced as a science, which implied that productivity can be maximized by managers controlling and formulating systematic workflows based on worker behaviors. As Taylor himself described it as “directly antagonistic to the old ideas that each workman can best regulate his own way of doing the work” (Taylor, 1911). After the industrial revolution in the 18th century, management was somewhat unorganized and irrelevant to production in factories (Citeman, 2008). Taylor’s approach had given more defined roles to managers to improve efficiency. Meanwhile, in the 1890s, America expanded into a modern industrial country, with massive growth in factories where more efficient management practices were in great needs (Caldari, 2007). Taylor’s suggestions on initiatives and incentives were dominant and widely adopted in worker-motivation and productivity from 1900-20 (Miller &amp; Form, 1952). In his well-known experiment of pig iron, although he justified how his methods increased productivity and how workers earned more money in the end, the accuracy and reliability of his methodology were questioned by many researchers.</p>
<p>In particular, a study conducted in 2000 has shown that all data observed by Taylor have no inconsistencies at all, which is almost impossible for a practical experiment. There is also a lack of scientific evidence in Taylor’s incomplete storytelling (Wrege &amp; Hodgetts, 2000). The controversies did not stop there. Scientific management was accused to be inhuman, as workers are actually overworked and underpaid (Drury, 1915). Later theories have discovered other aspects that affect the productivity of employees. For instance, the human relation theory has highlighted the significance of social and human perspectives on motivation in the workplace and provided directions for the development of work psychology (Mayo, 1933). Braverman also suggested that Taylorism is simply a tool for capitalists to exercise control over workers and it might result in worker alienation and deskilling (Braverman, 1974). While Littler argued that Taylorism is the bureaucratization of the structure of control, the institutionalization of it is actually the key and as he put it, “has a continuing influence West and East” (Littler, 1978). Despite the criticisms and the emergence of newer management theories, parts of Taylorism still survived and in fact, a modern concept of neo-Taylorism, which binds most of Taylor’s original ideas with the psychological aspects to work is implemented in many businesses today (Pruijt, 2003).</p>
<p>Although these debates have made the issue more complicated, most researchers in the field do agree on his profound contribution and share a common understanding that there are still existences of Taylorism today (Taneja, et al., 2011). Therefore, this essay aims to discuss to what extent is Taylorism relevant and effective to the theory and practice of management today?</p>
<p><strong>2.Main Body:</strong><br>
<strong>2.1. Workers and managers</strong></p>
<p>One of the key concepts that Taylor developed was the time-and-motion study, which emphasizes breaking down workers’ behaviors and establishing the “one-best-way” to carry out tasks, and training workers systematically instead of leaving them to train themselves (Koumparoulis &amp; Solomos, 2012). It has undoubtedly improved workers’ productivity. This sense of standardization continuously proves its worthiness in not only numerous factories around the world today, but also in education. Recent research shows that a new form of Taylorism has emerged in 21st-century curriculum, as teachers’ practices are increasingly standardized by high-stake testing and scripted curriculum (Au, 2011). Initially, it aims to improve the general quality and efficiency of teaching in fields such as reading and sciences, which can be easily measured through standardized tests (Apple &amp; Jungck, 1990). However, the tasks of teachers become extremely basic, and their powers are usurped through constraints and curriculums. Unlike Taylorism, modern researchers have discovered more aspects to work motivation apart from monetary incentives. According to Pink, such practice would demotivate employees since autonomy is absent, which means teachers cannot perform in desired ways (Pink, 2009). In addition, an interview conducted in the workplace has shown that 40% of the interviewees think self-motivation has significant impacts on work creativity. The lack of creativity-relevant skills will discourage personal engagement and innovation (Amabile, 1988). Nevertheless, there is also evidence indicating that many personality traits of teaching-effective professors are also those of creative professors (Rushton, et al., 1983). It implies that the quality of teaching is affected by the creativity of teachers. Furthermore, this may also incur deskilling, since materials are pre-packaged, and teachers are only responsible for repetitive execution (Apple, 1995). In short, Taylorism has increased the productivity of workers and suggested how to motivate them, but only on a surface level.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the concepts of scientific management have indeed given managers more defined responsibilities and provided them with directions to utilize resources more efficiently (Chand, 2021). Littler argued that scientific management has much deeper implications than other ideologies such as human relation, as it leaves the structure of control and division of labor largely untouched. Whereas Taylorism has been institutionalized and rooted in managerial responsibility and training (Littler, 1978). However, Follet proposed the need for integrative unity, which involves workers having more control over their tasks and redistribution of function. Moreover, educate workers with general business knowledge would also help them to make intelligent decisions (Follet, 1925). This approach aims to blur the traditional line between managers and workers and encourage them to take more ownership in their roles so that everyone collectively contributes to the organization. Thus, modern managers need to integrate the interests of all parties. Barnard went even further than Follet. He addressed the nature of executive responsibility, which is much more complex than simply breaking down tasks and giving instructions to workers. He demonstrated the need for leaders to create value and faith for their workers (Barnard, 1938). The inability to do so may result in irresponsibility and moral conflicts of employees. Follet and Barnard both emphasized that managerial responsibility has evolved over time, there are more aspects that modern managers need to consider outside of Taylor’s restricted views.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Practice in the field &amp; Society</strong></p>
<p>With all these theories in mind, we shall look at some practical implementations in the field. Total quality management (TQM) has been widely put into practice by companies such as Ford and Toyota (Hashmi, 2012). It was derived from Deming’s 14 points of management, which suggests that companies need to make organization-wide efforts to continuously improve product quality while minimizing costs, thus gain competitiveness in the market (Deming, 1982). TQM highlights on manager’s role in designing detailed work processes to improve quality. In addition, management must continuously analyze the variabilities through surveillance and collecting systematic data from work processes. The analysis should also be understood by workers themselves (Hackman &amp; Wageman, 1995). TQM takes advantage of Taylor’s time and motion study, builds on its idea of cost-minimization and enhances its surveillance component. It aims to control the uniformity of products, workers and the entire system of production at all levels within the organization (Dahlgaard, et al., 1998). However, TQM has received similar criticisms as Taylorism, accused to be unethical since it overlooks the interests of workers and treats individuals indifferently as machines (Boje &amp; Winsor, 1993). Despite that, TQM’s initiative on continuous adjustments and analyzing variances using quantitative data still have a great contribution to modern control systems (Tarí, 2005).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, workers at Amazon are also experiencing a “twisted” version of Taylorism, namely the digital-Taylorism. Digital-Taylorism refers to the standardization and rationalization of knowledge work through information technology (Brown, et al., 2012). Amazon’s obsession with measuring productivity has been supercharged with digital technology and applied to not only industrial workers, but also service workers and managers (Schein, 2017). Reports show that Amazon has invented a wristband to track workers’ hands in real-time for surveillance. All tasks are accurately timed, and workers are required to retrieve an item every nine seconds for ten and half hours (SALAME, 2018). Meanwhile, Amazon also uses a complex system that integrates the tools of data, management and psychology to set targets and control managers. The performance of employees is constantly being measured by algorithms (Smith, 2020). Despite the demanding culture at Amazon, some former employees still claimed it to be humane and they were given the opportunity to share their opinions in meetings (Streitfeld &amp; Kantor, 2015). The socio-technical system has also emphasized the positive interrelationship between human and technology, which enhances both social and technical aspects of work (Trist, 1981). At the same time, a recent study indicates that the advancement of technology has complemented Taylorism by supplementing the human aspects. The contributions of employees are analyzed and highly valued at all levels (Uddina &amp; Hossainb, 2015).</p>
<p>On the other hand, digital-Taylorism has still been criticized for job dissatisfaction and decreasing motivation, since the knowledge workers have few opportunities to think (Glover, 2013). According to the goal-setting theory, such intense and difficult goals could also demotivate employees and make them feel even less committed (Locke, et al., 1981). Moreover, the theory of Personality Systems Interactions addresses that social interaction patterns vary between different people, sometimes employees impose their goals and needs on their peers, which might incur mental disorders (Kuhl, 2000). Early theories of work design like Taylorism, focused on efficiency and cost reduction, whereas the modern development of work design pays more attention to motivation and well-being (Arnold &amp; Randall, 2016). It is widely accepted that the variety and autonomy of the job have significant impacts on workers’ commitment and satisfaction (Wall, 1982). Some researchers have been investigating to combine both the efficiency element of Taylorism and the variety and autonomy element. Through experiment, they found that it was possible to improve both efficiency and satisfaction at the same time (MORGESON &amp; CAMPION, 2006). At this point, it is obvious that scientific management has proved its worthiness to modern organizations, but not in its original form.</p>
<p>As society progresses, Taylorism has also evolved over time to better suit the current organizational environments. Many studies have pointed out that businesses are shifting from being organization-oriented, which focuses on internal factors such as production efficiency to market-oriented, putting customers in the center (Fahy &amp; Jobber, 2015). Besides, successful modern companies tend to take advantages of both centralization and decentralization. Their underlying structures are simple but extremely flexible and adjustable. Most importantly, they live their commitment to people and put innovation at the heart (Waterman &amp; Peters, 1982). These differences in the business environment have forced Taylorism to change as well. From the examples discussed above, we can see that many modern theories are developed from the emergence of the original Taylorism and newer discoveries to management effectiveness, such as work psychology and digitalization.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, we have discussed the effectiveness of Taylorism from the perspective of both workers and managers in modern settings. It demonstrates that Taylorism has indeed provided a solid understanding and direction on efficiency, motivation and managerial responsibility, but only at a basic level. Then the practical evidence has also suggested that Taylorism is still relevant, it has even been re-formed and implemented in some of the biggest companies today. Therefore, to what extent is Taylorism relevant and effective in modern society? Even though the business environment has changed rapidly and there are many more aspects to consider in management since 1911, it is undoubtedly that Taylorism is still relevant today. However, how effective is it? As discussed, Taylorism today is no longer in its original form. In fact, a recent concept of the surplus population addresses that the workers whom Taylor originally described in scientific management are gradually being replaced by automated machines (Murray-Li, 2010). The modern Taylorism combines its initial proposal on productivity with later findings on management effectiveness. However, the fundamental problem seems unsolved. Similar to Amazon, call centers as another reflection of the digital-Taylorism shows that the many jobs are still repetitive under strict surveillance, and sometimes even unethical (Taylor &amp; Bain, 2003). The performance and outcome of such practice seem productive though, so is it effective? In the past when Taylorism was developed, the phrase “management effectiveness” was almost exclusively regarded to production efficiency, whereas now it also concerns the ability to adjust to the changing environment, ethics, work psychology and much more (Waterman &amp; Peters, 1982). Under the new definition of management effectiveness, Taylorism today fails to be effective. However, the irony, the tragedy is exactly the fact that Taylorism is still hugely relevant in modern management practices. Perhaps the nature of the work that Taylor described has never changed fundamentally, it has only transformed into the shell of more modernized roles, such as teachers, call agents or programmers. This raises the concern that management practices might never find a way around Taylorism.</p>

<p><strong>整理文献就像写论文一样，是一个积累的过程。千万不要把所有文献都攒到最后写完论文了再整理，真的很崩溃！！</strong></p>
<p><strong>这个方法利用Word自带的引用功能，虽然需要手动输入source的信息，但输入后，它会自动生成intext reference和 bibliography。</strong></p>
<p><strong>最重要的是，这个方法能强迫你一边写一边引用，用到一个source就直接输入系统。用久了之后甚至很上瘾，很有满足感！！</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>打开Word - 我用的是英文版，但是word里对应的位置都是一样的！<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>然后点到Reference/引用栏<br>
<img src="https://xin0109.github.io/post-images/1621144494276.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>点击Citation &amp; Bibliography<br>
<img src="https://xin0109.github.io/post-images/1621144585045.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>

<li>
<p>在右边我们可以选择引用格式（intext&amp;bibliography），我们学校要求的是Harvard。<br>
<img src="https://xin0109.github.io/post-images/1621144637314.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>选好格式后我们就可以开始引用啦，点击insert citation，会出现下面这个页面<br>
<img src="https://xin0109.github.io/post-images/1621144727793.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>我们可以选择你的source的类型，比如说我想引用一本书上的内容，那我就直接填上书的信息，点击确认<br>
<img src="https://xin0109.github.io/post-images/1621144767931.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>在insert citation旁边，有一个citation的选项，点击这个可以查看我们目前为止所有引用的source<br>
<img src="https://xin0109.github.io/post-images/1621145051645.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>在你写完论文，把所有引用都加进系统后，你可以点Bibliography，来自动生成你的reference list<br>
<img src="https://xin0109.github.io/post-images/1621145146513.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
<img src="https://xin0109.github.io/post-images/1621145162153.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>这样就大功告成啦！！</p>
<p>我一直是使用Word自带的引用，我也尝试过第三方网站，例如citethisforme。我个人觉得这种网站也没方便到哪去，很多时候它也找不着文献信息，而且还很容易乱。</p>
<p>直接输入到Word系统里能够更高效的整理这些文献，也不会丢失。当你用习惯了之后甚至会很享受引用的过程（很有做学术研究的感觉！！）</p>
<p>感谢阅读！</p>

<p>University plays a key role in the changes and transformations in our society (Brennan, et al., 2004). In recent years, issues regarding equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) have become the central topic around the world and universities must take initiatives to solve these problems. Equality is often regarded as having equal rights and opportunities instead of everyone being identical (Caruana &amp; Ploner, 2010). Scheffler claims that equality can be classified as distributive and relational equality. The former refers to egalitarian distribution of resources, whereas the latter is an ideal governing certain kind of interpersonal relationships (Scheffler, 2015). On the other hand, inequality and discrimination against certain groups has existed for centuries. Woman’s right to education and racial segregation are historical examples of inequality in education due to differences in gender and race (Zajda, 2009). In recent years, these differences have been reconceptualized as diversity, and it is defined or perceived as a competitive advantage, a diverse group of people are able to bring new skills and aptitudes (Wood, et al., 2006). Diversity can be either physical which refers to bio-demographic differences, or cognitive, differences in perspectives and problem-solving habits (ELI Inc., 2020). Inclusion in the broader sense is to embrace the minorities so that they feel accepted and equally treated (Global Diversity Practice, 2020). However, inclusivity these days often exclusively refers to disability education (Schuelka, et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Bear in mind that these interpretations are not definite. Educators in the fields lack a common understanding of these concepts. One of the examples is the Least Restrictive Environment law in the US, which states that students with disabilities should study alongside with other peers in the same classroom (Copenhaver, 2006). However, Crockett and Kauffman argued that such an approach to inclusion might result in an even more restrictive environment for disabled students than segregated classrooms (Crockett &amp; Kauffman, 2013). These differences in understanding are due to perspectives and personality traits. Students with disabilities who are also outgoing might enjoy studying with other peers, whereas some might find it awkward and depressing (Ashton, 2013). The social identity theory suggests that one’s self image is associated with the comparisons between himself and relevant social groups, which can also have significant impacts on intergroup behaviours (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). In this case, disabled students might have negative associations when comparing themselves to normal students. Therefore, it is essential to focus on developing both behavioural strategies as well as physical implementations, such as policies.</p>
<p>This essay aims to discover the possible implementations that would achieve a higher degree of EDI. It is crucial to approach the problem from different perspectives in order for a comprehensive respond. It is also necessary to discuss to what extent do these recommendations work in the context of higher education.</p>
<h2 id="main-body">Main body</h2>
<p>Equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) have become the main theme in higher education in recent year. As there is no one universal understanding to EDI, universities around the world have taken different approaches and faced various challenges. A commonly used approach is to set up dedicated teams and sections on the website to acknowledge the importance of EDI. For instance, the University of Manchester (UoM) produces reports on their progress annually, including initiatives, policies and more (University of Manchester, 2020). This is an effective practice that would not only make a clear statement to the public, but also raise awareness in EDI. However, this information can be selective and incomplete. There is a lack of specific data for each course program. According to research, some fields of study are much less diverse. Such as the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Data from American Physical Society has shown that only about 12% of the total students receiving bachelor’s degree and 7% receiving PhD in physics are from underrepresented backgrounds in the US (APS physics, 2018). To resolve the problem, the University of Michigan (UM) initiated the Applied Physics program where they enhance the collaborations between physics department and other departments (Clarke &amp; Kurdak, 2019). It provides underrepresented students with more information and opportunities to explore the world of physics and counters the perception of “few career paths”. This approach was able to increase the percentage of underrepresented students receiving physics PhD to 23%. Also, 29% of physics PhD were awarded to women in UM, whereas only 17% on average in the US. Many underrepresented students in the PhD program are willing to become mentors for incoming students and it is foreseeable that EDI will continue to improve. As a result, it is suggested that universities should first acknowledge all existing or potential issues to a higher degree of specification. In order to gain more accurate insights and find out the internal drivers of underrepresented students, we can approach the problem using learning theories. The theory of constructivism suggests that people construct their knowledge based on their reality and experiences. The construction is also directly associated with learners’ social connections (WGU, 2020). In this case, underrepresented students might have little or no knowledge at all in many subject areas due to their limited personal experiences. For instance, science is one of the most expensive degrees and students from low-income families might just give up on their interests in sciences (Else, 2015). University should provide opportunities for students to get exposed and have hands-on experiences in these areas of study. This can not only be implemented through university staff, other social connections such as peers and industrial partners can be effective as well. ¬¬</p>
<p>Another controversial topic in EDI is gender equality. In particular, gender equality for university staff has been overlooked compared to students. There was a widespread idea that the student equality is a greater priority than staff equality (DEEM &amp; MORLEY, 2006). A study of attitudes to gender equality in the UK and Germany has shown that although there were only very little harassments or unfair practices against female in HE nowadays, 73% of the participants still thought their university is a gendered workplace and 78% thought there were too few women in senior roles (Pritchard, 2010). More recent evidence suggests that in the UK, of all academic staff described as a professor, only 25% are female (HESA, 2018). This implies that male power still dominates in university academics. On the other side of the world, Australian universities have had outstanding progress in gender equality. In 2017 45.4% of academic staff and 32.4% of senior academic staff are female (Larkins, 2017). One of the techniques is that a sample of employees will be selected annually from every organization to report against a set of criteria regarding organizations’ efforts towards gender equality (Australian Legislation, 2000). This act had great effects in monitoring organizations and provided insights on how to improve gender equality in the workplace. The engagement of community leaders is also essential in order to make greater influence and sustain positive changes (Haider, 2012). An action plan initiated by senior women in Australian universities involved setting up multiple development programmes for female academic staff.  More recently, they have built on this plan which emphasizes the recognition of the contributions of women to universities, the importance of mentoring women in middle management as future leaders and the showcase of senior executive women at strategic points throughout the programmes (Winchester &amp; Browning, 2015). The significance of these strategies is clear, universities must provide extra supports and information to close the gender gaps in professional developments (Traning Journal, 2015), so that women have the same career opportunities as men. However, information might not be enough to change behaviors and this is why behavior sciences are vital in this process (Mantashian, 2019). The nudge theory states that our behaviors and decisions are largely affected by positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions in the environment (Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008). Google has one of the most elaborate workplace environments. Creative settings such as treadmills or Tinker Toys in the office have improved employees’ wellbeing and productivity (Stewart, 2013). Therefore, the way that university offices and classrooms are set up can have significant impact on people’s behaviors towards gender equality.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>UM’s approach to enhance collaboration between departments, initiatives taken by Australian universities to promote female academics have impacted EDI significantly in a positive way. And their methods have commonalities. These evidences have suggested that universities must ensure that everyone has equal access to essential information and opportunities, identify underrepresented groups and extra support should also be made available for these groups. At the same time, the importance of behavioral strategies is as critical as physical policies. Due to the differences in personality and experiences, educators might not need a common definition and different perspectives are actually needed to address injustices (Schuelka, et al., 2019). Despite multiple perspectives have been taken into account, the coverage of this essay is still limited. There are simply much more aspects that educators need to consider, especially when dealing with personality traits. For instance, the cognitive diversity theory studies beyond the common identity diversity such as race and gender (ELI Inc., 2020), it creates more layers of complexity in achieving EDI. This might be an indication that universities will never be able to take consideration of all factors. But is that the goal anyways? At this stage, more questions have been raised which are out of the scope of the essay. In fact, all recommendations made in this essay would only be partially effective. Yet as long as universities show consistent commitments to these issues, EDI will continue to improve and these questions will eventually be resolved, not only in classrooms, but also in society.</p>
